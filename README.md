# KNN_Algorithm
### k-Nearest Neighbors or k-NN is one of the simplest algorithms in the field of Machine Learning. It is mostly used for solving classification problems, but can also be used for regression tasks. In this article, we will go over an example of a k-NN classifier built from scratch using Python.

In this repo I'm building the k-NN from scratch and testing its results on a toy dataset. The code can be found in Fruits.ipynb.
